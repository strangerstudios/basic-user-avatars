# Contribute to Paid Memberships Pro

Paid Memberships Pro is the "community solution" for membership sites on WordPress, and so contributions of all kinds are appreciated.

When contributing, please follow these guidelines to ensure things work as smoothly as possible.

__Please Note:__ GitHub is for bug reports and contributions only. If you have a support or customization question, go to our [Member Support Page](http://www.paidmembershipspro.com/support/) instead.

## Getting Started

* __Do not report potential security vulnerabilities here. Email them privately to [info@paidmembershipspro.com](mailto:info@paidmembershipspro.com) with the words "Security Vulnerability" in the subject.__
* Submit a ticket for your issue, assuming one does not already exist.
  * Raise it on our [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/strangerstudios/Basic-User-Avatarss/issues)
  * Clearly describe the issue including steps to reproduce the bug.
  * Make sure you fill in the earliest version that you know has the issue as well as the version of WordPress you're using.

## Making Changes

* Fork the repository on GitHub
* For bug fixes, checkout the DEV branch of the PMPro repository.
* For new features and enhancements, checkout the branch for the version the feature is milestoned for.
* Make sure to pull in any "upstream" changes first.
	* Use `git remote add upstream https://github.com/strangerstudios/Basic-User-Avatarss.git` to set the upstream repo
	* Use `git checkout dev` to get on the development branch.
	* Use `git pull upstream dev` to get the latest updates.
	* Use `git push` to push those updates to your fork.
* Create a new local branch for each separate bug fix or feature. This will ensure that each pull request is for one issue only and easier to process.
	* Use `git checkout -b nameofmybugfixorfeature` to create the new branch
* Make the changes to your local repository.
* Ensure you stick to the [WordPress Coding Standards](https://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Coding_Standards) (even though much of the PMPro code does not currently)
* If you have an automatic beautifier in your IDE or dev environment, turn it off. Unrelated style changes in your pull requests will make them harder to process. Feel free to message the core development team to ask them to clean up a file you are working on if the inconsitent coding styles is bothering you.
* You can update the readme.txt to include a comment about your fix or feature in the changelog, but if you do not the core team will do it for you.
* When committing, reference your issue (if present) and include a note about the fix in the commit message.
* Push the changes to your fork.
* For bug fixes, submit a pull request to the DEV branch of the PMPro repository.
* For new features and enhancements, submit a pull request to the version the feature is milestoned for. This will usually be the version number following the current release unless the core dev team has milestoned the feature for a later release.
* We will process all pull requests and make suggestions or changes as soon as possible. Feel free to ping us politely via email or social networks to take a look at your pulls.

## Code Documentation

* We would like for every function, filter, class, and class method to be documented using phpDoc standards.
* An example of [how PMPro uses phpDoc blocks can be found here](https://gist.github.com/sunnyratilal/5308969).
* Please make sure that every function is documented so that when we update our API Documentation things don't go awry!
	* If you're adding/editing a function in a class, make sure to add `@access {private|public|protected}`
* Finally, please use tabs and not spaces. The tab indent size should be 4 for all Paid Memberships Pro code.
